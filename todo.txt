Short term:
- Improve error handling & data validation in frontend.
- Design better Game Status display.
- Write proper unit tests.

Long term (if we go that far):
- Add ability to explicitly load saved game from homepage.
- Convert objects to SQLAlchemy models.
- Build game history & multi-user capability.

Ideas:
- Make instructions to run locally via Docker?
- Game class: Separate the inference engine from pure recording functions?
- Convert diagram to Mermaid-generated?
